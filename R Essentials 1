We want users to be able to begin in an interactive environment, 
where they did not consiencely think of themselves as programming.
Then as their needs become clearer and their sophistication increased,
they should be able to slide gradually into programming,
when the language and system aspects would become more important.

Drawbacks:
There is little support for dynamic / 3D graphics




xx <- 1:10 #Create a series of 10 integers from 1 to 10.

yy <- rnorm(10) #Simulate 10 random observations from a standard normal distribution

objects() #Prints list of all the objects created in session
ls()


plot(xx,yy) #Produce scatter plot

One of the big advantages of working with R is the ability to use libraries developed by users. 
The base R comes with the following preloaded set of libraries:
getOption("defaultPackages")  #base packages 

install.packages("BeyesCR") 
install.packages("BeyesCR", depends=TRUE)

library() #installed packages

Working directories
getwd() #default saving folderr

setwd("C:/Users/Curwan/Documents/") #set set to other directory
setwd("H:Documents/")

x=10
ls() #Prints list of all the objects created in session

rm(x) #Remove objects from workspace

character(0)

options*digets = 16) #Increase number of decimals

**NB HELP function using ? preceding the function
?getwd
